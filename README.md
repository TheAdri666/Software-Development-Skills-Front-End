# Software-Development-Skills-Front-End

Project for the Front End part of the Software Development Skills course

## How to run the project

To run the project simply visit the site (https://theadri666.github.io/Software-Development-Skills-Front-End/) or download the repo and open the index.html file in the Final-Project directory. If you are planning on updating the styling simply run `npm run sass` and edit the scss files as needed, then simply save the file and the css will automatically update. If you want to also update the site automatically and are using VSCode you can get the Live Server extension by Ritwick Dey.
