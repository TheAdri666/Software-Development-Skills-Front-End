        <p>
          Manjaro is an Arch based distribution developed mostly in Europe, it
          is very popular with users who want to have an experience similar to
          the one Arch Linux offers (i.e. rolling release, bleeding-edge
          technologies, pacman, the <i>AUR</i> among others) but who don't want
          to go through the process of learning the Arch Linux installation and
          through the likely troubleshooting process that comes after installing
          Arch because of missing packages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Manjaro is a very fast, easy to install distro that, at the cost of a
          couple weeks of wait time can be much more stable than Arch, as it has
          a testing version where the rolling release can be safely tested
          before releasing it to the public.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though Manjaro has some officially supported desktop environments
          it also features a lot of community maintained ones, which lets users
          make any choice of desktop environment, whichever their preferred one
          may be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Manjaro emphasizes user privacy and tries to offer the most amount of
          control over the computer's hardware as possible. It also supports
          x86_64 architechtures as well as ARM, which makes it a great choice
          for almost any device.
        </p>
        <p>
          Manjaro is much better suited to a desktop device as it doesn't
          feature a server edition, and any server would be resource-limited by
          the desktop environment that Manjaro is running, even if it is a
          low-end dekstop environment such as LXDE. Additionally one of the most
          common goals when configuring a server is stability, which is harder
          to achieve with Manjaro than with a non-rolling release distribution
          with long update intervals such as Debian.
