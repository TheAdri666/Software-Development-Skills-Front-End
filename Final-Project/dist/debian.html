        <p>
          Debian is a distribution that has long been considered the mother of
          Linux distributions, it starts one of the two big branches of Linux
          distributions today, the other one being Arch Linux, but Debian's is
          much larger. Because Debian has a two year gap in between versions
          with only small security updates in between it tends to lag behind
          other distributions in terms of bleeding-edge technology. This however
          makes Debian a really stable distribution, which makes it great for
          industry. It is not often that a Debian system runs into conflict.
          Debian is highly popular, being the main theme of several Linux-based
          conferences (DebCon) and is moderately easy to set up. It does a great
          job at both, server and desktop.
