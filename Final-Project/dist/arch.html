        <p>
          Arch is a Linux distribution that has a very lightweight default
          installation so that every user can make their own custom install with
          only the packages they need. It provides a solid base to start from
          and it is good for both desktop and servers, although it does require
          some dedication to get into as it is not the most user-friendly
          distro. It has a fantastic wiki and forum where one is almost sure to
          find the answer to any problem they might encounter and the
          <i>Arch User Repository</i> or <i>AUR</i> provides an excellent way
          for users to publish or adapt any kind of packages to this
          distribution and the distributions based on it like Manjaro or
          Endeavour OS. Lastly, its rolling release model makes it so that it is
          usually the one that first to receive the latest updates. This comes,
          of course, with the risk of running into security problems and
          compatibility issues, which is the main reason why it is not an
          industry standard, unlike Debian.
